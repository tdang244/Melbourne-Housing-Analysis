# Melbourne-Housing-Analysis
As a final deliverable for my Statistical Machine Learning course, I performed two analyses on the Melbourne housing dataset on Kaggle using Machine Learning techniques with R.\
My motivation to analyze a housing dataset is Simpson's Paradox. I remembered seeing for the first time a Simpsonâ€™s paradox related to a housing dataset in my first Statistical Modeling class. It was pretty eye-opening to get very counter-intuitive results, and later discover the lurking variables that cause the controversy. I have learned to be much more critical in statistical modeling and machine learning due to those occurrences, and I hope to stumble upon some in this dataset.
